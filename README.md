# Telegram bot

### exif-data_telegram-bot

My first **Python** practice. Simple bot that receives a photo and returns some data from exif

I never wrote a single line of code in Python before, so go easy on me =)

i use:  
[pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)  
[Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)  

> to be able to launch this bot you're gonna need **config.json** file in root folder:
```json
{
  "TG_API_TOKEN": "",
  "proxy": {
    "ip": "",
    "port": "",
    "user": "",
    "password": ""
  }
}
```
